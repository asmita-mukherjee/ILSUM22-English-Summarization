worrying is the variant first seen in india?for the first time in months, people across england are meeting indoors at pubs, restaurants, cinemas, gyms and elsewhere as coronavirus rules were relaxed this week. but prime minister boris johnson warned britons to be cautious and some of the scientists advising him say restrictions might need to be reimposed quickly because of worrying variant first detected in india.heres look at what we know and dont know about the variant:what is this variant?the covid-19 variant first identified in india has been classified as “variant of concern” by britain and the world health organisation, meaning there is some evidence that it spreads more easily between people, causes more severe disease, or might be less responsive to treatments and vaccines.“the absolute numbers of cases of the variant in the uk remain quite small, but the growth rate is quite high,” said nick loman, professor of microbial genomics at the university of birmingham.to date, there have been more than 2,300 cases identified in britain. figures released by public health england show cases of the variant first detected in india have tripled in the past week and experts say its on track to become the most dominant covid-19 variant in the country.maria van kerkhove, whos covid-19 technical lead, said more information was still needed about the variants spread globally.“we need more sequencing, targeted sequencing to be done and to be shared in india and elsewhere so that we know how much of this virus is circulating,” she said.how transmissible is the variant?we dont entirely know. but according to the minutes of an expert group advising the government last week, scientists said “it is realistic possibility that the variant first seen in india is as much as 50% more transmissible” than the variant first reported in britain whose explosive spread led to the countrys longest lockdown in january.“there are plausible biological reasons as to why some of the mutations present could make this variant more transmissible,” they concluded.if the variant proves to be 40 to 50% more transmissible, the scientists predicted that would “lead to much larger peak” of cases, hospitalisations and deaths than previous waves of coronavirus particularly if the government continues with its existing plans to exit lockdown.dr jeremy farrar, director of the wellcome trust and one of the scientists advising the government, said it was entirely possible the covid-19 restrictions relaxed on monday might need to be reintroduced soon if the variants spread leads to spike in hospitalisations and deaths.“a very careful lifting of restrictions is reasonable, but we may have to reverse that,” farrar warned. experts think the next few weeks should provide more details about how quickly the variant identified in india is sickening people and whether that might overwhelm hospitals.johnson said any proof the variant identified in india is more dangerous could “pose serious disruption” to the uk governments plans to lift all remaining covid-19 restrictions next month.do vaccines work against this variant?scientists think so but are still waiting for definitive answers.at press briefing last week, marco cavaleri, head of vaccines at the european medicines agency, said the data appeared “rather reassuring” that vaccines made by pfizer-biontech and moderna would protect against the variant first seen in india.he said the agency was still gathering more information on the effectiveness of the shots made by astrazeneca and johnson johnson and was “pretty confident” those vaccines too would afford people enough protection from the variant.“urgent experimental data is being generated for this variant ,” said sharon peacock of the uk covid-19 genomics consortium. she noted that vaccines appear to work against other variants to date but that it is important to determine if one dose is effective or if two are needed.in the areas of the uk worst hit by the variant, britains health secretary matt hancock said most people hospitalised had “chosen not to have the jab.”on monday, johnson said people over 50 and those with underlying health conditions would have their wait for second vaccine dose cut from 12 weeks to eight, over concerns about the variants rapid spread.also read: who didnt use term indian variant for b.1.617 strain:

economic growth, connectivity, and unity among membersin his address at the summit, modi, in clear reference to the bri, said any mega connectivity project must respect sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries and assured that india will support projects which ensure inclusivity. connectivity with the neighbouring countries is indias priority. we welcome the connectivity projects which are sustainable and efficient and which respect territorial integrity and sovereignty of the countries, he said.india has been severely critical of the bri, the pet project of chinese president xi jinping, as the usd 50 billion china pakistan economic corridor cpec which is part of the bri, passes through pakistan-occupied kashmir pok .india says it cannot accept project that ignores its core concerns on sovereignty and territorial integrity.in his address, xi also talked about bri, noting that member countries should respect choice of development paths and accommodate each others core interests and major concerns. all parties will continue to work in line with the principle of mutual benefit to improve regional economic cooperation arrangements, enhance the belt and road cooperation and complementarity of our respective development strategies, he said.modi, in presence of xi and russian president vladimir putin, said indias commitment to connectivity projects was reflected in its involvement in the international north south corridor project, development of the chabahar port and ashgabat agreement.china had unveiled the bri in 2013 with an aim to link southeast asia, central asia, the gulf region, africa and europe with network of land and sea routes.president xi has already announced that china would invest around usd 126 billion for the project.however, there has been suspicion among several countries that the main aim of the project is to expand chinas influence globally.according to chinese officials, around 80 countries and international organisations have already inked pacts with beijing for the ambitious project. the member states express appreciation for the joint efforts taken towards its implementation, including efforts to coordinate the development of the eurasian economic union and the bri and call for using the potential of the regional countries, international organisations and multilateral associations to create broad, open, mutually beneficial and equal partnership in the sco space, said the declaration on the bri.it said the sco member countries pointed out the potential of coordinating international, regional and national development projects and strategies for stimulating cooperation in the interests of economic development based on the principles of respect, equality and mutual benefit.in his address, pakistani president mamnoon hussain whole-heartedly supported the bri, saying it was boosting pakistans economy.the international north–south transport corridor instc is 7,200-km-long multi-mode transport project for moving freight among india, iran, afghanistan, armenia, azerbaijan, russia, central asia and europe.ashgabat agreement is transport agreement among several gulf and

in india for the first time in months people across england are meeting indoors at pubs restaurants cinemas gyms and elsewhere as coronavirus rules were relaxed this week but prime minister boris johnson warned britons to be cautious and some of the scientists advising him say restrictions might need to be reimposed quickly because of worrying variant first detected in india heres look at what we know and dont know about the variant what is this variant the covid 19 variant first identified in india has been classified as “variant of concern” by britain and the world health organisation meaning there is some evidence that it spreads more easily between people causes more severe disease or might be less responsive to treatments and vaccines “the absolute numbers of cases of the variant in the uk remain quite small but the growth rate is quite high ” said nick professor of microbial genomics at the university of birmingham to date there have been more than 2 300 cases identified in britain figures released by public health england show cases of the variant first detected in india have tripled in the past week and experts say its on track to become the most dominant covid 19 variant in the country maria van kerkhove whos covid 19 technical lead said more information was still needed about the variants spread globally “we need more sequencing targeted sequencing to be done and to be shared in india and elsewhere so that we know how much of this virus is circulating ” she said how transmissible is the variant we dont entirely know but according to the minutes of an expert group advising the government last week scientists said “it is realistic possibility that the variant first seen in india is as much as 50 more than the variant first reported in britain whose explosive spread led to the countrys longest lockdown in january “there are plausible biological reasons as to why some of the mutations present could make this variant more transmissible ” they concluded if the variant proves to be 40 to 50 more transmissible the scientists predicted that would “lead to much larger of cases hospitalisations and deaths than previous waves of coronavirus particularly if the government continues with its existing plans to exit lockdown dr jeremy farrar director of the wellcome trust and one of the scientists advising the government said it was entirely possible the covid 19 restrictions relaxed on monday might need to be reintroduced soon if the variants spread leads to spike in hospitalisations and deaths “a very careful lifting of restrictions is reasonable but we may have to reverse that ” farrar warned experts think the next few weeks should provide more details about how quickly the variant identified in india is sickening people and whether that might overwhelm hospitals johnson said any proof the variant identified in india is more dangerous could “pose serious disruption” to the uk governments plans to lift all remaining covid 19 restrictions next month do vaccines work against this variant scientists think so but are still waiting for definitive answers at press briefing last week marco cavaleri head of vaccines at the european medicines agency said the data appeared “rather that vaccines made by pfizer biontech and moderna would protect against the variant first seen in india he said the agency was still gathering more information on the effectiveness of the shots made by astrazeneca and johnson johnson and was “pretty confident” those vaccines too would afford people enough protection from the variant “urgent experimental data is being generated for this variant ” said sharon peacock of the uk covid 19 genomics consortium she noted that vaccines appear to work against other variants to date but that it is important to determine if one dose is effective or if two are needed in the areas of the uk worst hit by the variant britains health secretary matt hancock said most people hospitalised had not to have the jab ”on monday johnson said people over 50 and those with underlying health conditions would have their wait for second vaccine dose cut from 12 weeks to eight over concerns about the variants rapid spread also read who didnt use term indian variant for b 1 617 strain health read who classifies indian covid strain as variant of concern \n","\n","1/1 [==============================]

and recent review found significant concerns with his inadequate reports professor simon kim consultant at sheffield teaching hospitals carried out the review into ahmed who qualified as medic in
